# radiPanel: Marky's spin

Forked from Radipanel: RC 2 by Matthew Gall (iCame), Josh (Josh)

radiPanel: Marky's spin is an fork of the PHP / MySQL powered radiPanel system developed by Josh under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 UK: England & Wales Licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/).

This version implements security fixes and better password hashing etc. Basically you are not going to be able to gain new premissions by editing the page source in developer tools (F12) that was a disaster.
